          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="about-text">I'm Leanne Lacey-Byrne, back in 2011 I graduated from Maynooth University in Ireland with a Double Honors Degree in Computer Science and Biology, two of my passions. Since then I've lived all over, working in the pharmecutical industry before realising it's web development that makes me tick! I am an extremely approachable, driven and friendly individual who wants to help you get the best from the web! I currently live in sunny Malta and am employed as a Junior Web Developer. If you'd like to reach out and get in touch, I would be delighted to have a chat.
