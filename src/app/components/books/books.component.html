            Guys, I can't say enough about this fantastic resource for anyone learning JS. Really helpful, you can
            get them all FREE, all 6 books. You can purchase these in Kindle, hardback or paperback versions. If you
            have the spare doe and would like a copy, I recommend going for it, splash out! As it's such a great and
            coherent resource to have in the arsenal and supporting the author who made these brilliant resources
            free just seems right!

            For anyone who hasn't already, check out Jeffery Archer. He's a genius. His book Kane and Able, in my
            opinion is a masterpeice.
